This GIS application was developed more than two decades ago. It serves as a reference for my current project, which is being implemented using the latest technologies. You may notice that some data tables employ my name as a temporary table, and that some variable names deviate from best practices. I will refrain from these practices in my future endeavors. At the very least, this serves as evidence that I was a programmer over two decades ago and that I am not merely dabbling in code for personal amusement.

When I was younger, I used my name as the table name, which is not a good practice.
